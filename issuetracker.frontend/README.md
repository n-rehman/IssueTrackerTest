# Starter Kit used from facebook creat-react-app

## Get Started

1. **Install [Node 18](https://nodejs.org)** or newer.
2. **Navigate to this project's root directory on the command line.**
3. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`


**Client/FrontEnd**
| Built in react 17
| Recommend using Vs Code
| Open Folder in vs code IssueTracker\issuetracker.frontend
| Run npm install
| Go to Package.json and replace port for variable REACT_APP_TICKETS_API_URL to web api port noted when running web api from Visual Studio i.e REACT_APP_TICKETS_API_URL=https://localhost:7206
| If you don't see data, it means web api isn't running or port settings are incorrect in pacakage.json file
| Having issues? See below.

### Having Issues running front end ? Try these things first:

1. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll get an error when you try to start the app later.
2. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It will cause issues with file watches.
3. Delete any .eslintrc in your user directory and disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules within your editor since these will conflict with the ESLint rules defined in the course.
4. On Windows? Open your console as an administrator. This will assure the console has the necessary rights to perform installs.
5. Ensure you do not have NODE_ENV=production in your env variables as it will not install the devDependencies. To check run this on the command line: `set NODE_ENV`. If it comes back as production, you need to clear this env variable.
6. Nothing above work? Delete your node_modules folder and re-run npm install.
7. If don't see data ensure web api is running & ensure port is correct in REACT_APP_TICKETS_API_URL i.e same where web api is running
